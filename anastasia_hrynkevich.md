### Summary
___
Having relocated to the UK more than five years ago, I have settled here. Since moving to the UK, I have shown a great deal of adaptability and willingness to develop personally by learning English. I have put a great deal of effort into teaching myself web development skills to start my path toward a career in web development. I have learnt how WWW works, HTML, and CSS languages, Bootstrap, SASS. I have been learning JavaScript and practising my knowledge on WebStorm using Git.  

I would be happy to work in an IT company to reach the goals that would allow me to improve my life skills and ability to communicate with others and work in a team. I think that these aspects will give me the flexibility to be able to reach my true potential.  

Having skills in creative attitude, self-motivated I believe I am willing to learn. I will do a lot of background work through self-education and exploring topics by myself. Being creative in day-to-day life will perfectly fit the web technologies career.

### Code example
___
*Let the variable num store a number. If this number falls within the range from 10 to 99, then find the sum of the digits of this number. If the resulting sum is less than or equal to 9, then print a message that the sum of the digits is single-digit, otherwise, print a message that the sum of the digits is two-digit.*

```sh
let num = 82;
if (num >= 10 && num < 99) {
    let secondNumber = num % 10;
    let firstNumber = (num - secondNumber) / 10;
    let sum = secondNumber + firstNumber;
    if (sum <= 9) {
        console.log('The sum of the digits is single-digit');
    } else {
